# Module 14 Challenge 

_____________________________________________


# Intro
In this challenge, I created an algorythmic trading bot that is supposed to trade faster than human traders. This is intended to give the firm I work for a competitive advantage. 

# Observations 
During the assignment, we were supposed to observe and record our comparisons of the machine learning models. I had some difficulties with my code, so my observations didn't seem entirely accurate. For my comparisons, I used the SVC classifier and the Logistic Regression classifier from the Supervised Learning unit. Unless I was using them incorrectly, it looked like the Logistic Regression model performed better than the baseline model.
